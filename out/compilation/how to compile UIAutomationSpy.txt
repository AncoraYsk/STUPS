1. Download the latest SharpDevelop from their build server
http://build.sharpdevelop.net/BuildArtefacts/
For simplicity sake, take an xcopyable version. For today, the latest is SharpDevelop_5.0.0.4611.Xcopyable.zip
http://build.sharpdevelop.net/BuildArtefacts/SharpDevelop_5.0.0.4611.Xcopyable.zip
Unpack it to a folder, in my case this is F:\SharpDevelop
and run F:\SharpDevelop\bin\SharpDevelop.exe 

2. Download source code, this is a package called STUPS-master.zip
Unpack it to a folder, for example, F:\STUPS-master
Open F:\STUPS-master\STUPS.sln

3. Now, we need to set up configuration. This is legacy and need to be changed, however, it takes time to change.
Okay, just use what is needed:
Main menu -> Build -> Set configuration -> Release35
Main menu -> Build -> Set platform -> Release35
The overwhelming majority of projects should be seen as Release35 in the Build -> Edit configurations/platforms dialog

4. It's time to download dependencies
right click on the project (UIAutomationSpy) and click on Restore Packages

5. Some minor fixes, just do it
right click on the project (UIAutomationSpy, Tmx, ) and click on Properties -> the Compiling tab -> the Output Path text box -> type in bin\Release35\

6. Compile!
right click on the project (UIAutomationSpy) and click on Rebuild

7. Test it!
go to the folder F:\STUPS-master\UIA\UIAutomationSpy\bin\Release35 and run UIAutomationSpy.exe
